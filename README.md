# digarch-introgisonline

This is a short introductory activity using ArcGIS Online. It provides a brief tour of the online geospatial interface and the user learns some basic symbology skills, as well as how to read an attribute table. If ArcGIS Online's data repository does not have the datasets stored, I have provided zip files in this repository.
